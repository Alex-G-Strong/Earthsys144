# Installing WhiteBoxGAT

Whitebox is free and open source, and although many of the functions are available in QGIS, as we have seen in QGIS many are works in progress, and somewhat problematic in application.

Whitebox GAT software is available from:  [http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hydrogeo/Whitebox/download.shtml](http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hydrogeo/Whitebox/download.shtml)

 ## Installation

 **Download** the sofware from the above URL, **unzip** it, then **move** it to a secure location on your computer where it won't be accidentally deleted, or synced to Dropbox/Box.com/Google Drive/iCloud, etc...

 THe Guidance on the homepage mentions updating your Java SE, but you should try running the software, first, as some folks are having issues with newer Java Version not running the app. I've had good luck with the dfault version of Java on my Mac, using Catalina 10.15.7
